## Course project 1

This repo contains files required for submission to the first Course project assignment from the Exploratory Data Analysis course.

Four R-script files contain the code that produces the plots in the four png files.
All the scripts assume that the required data has been downloaded from <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">here</a> and the file has been extracted to the same directory as the scripts.
